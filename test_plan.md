**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Prepared By:** [Your Name / Team]  
**Project Name:** CarMaker Digital Key  

## 1. Introduction  
### 1.1 Purpose  
This test plan defines the strategy, scope, objectives, and execution process for testing the **CarMaker Digital Key** implementation. The goal is to ensure compliance with **CCC Digital Key specifications**, interoperability with supported devices, security, and functional reliability.  

### 1.2 Scope  
This test plan covers:  
- **Functional Testing:** Digital key creation, storage, sharing, revocation, and vehicle access.  
- **Interoperability Testing:** Compatibility with multiple smartphone manufacturers (Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, etc.).  
- **Security Testing:** Authentication, encryption validation, and penetration testing.  
- **Performance Testing:** Response time, network latency, and battery consumption.  

### 1.3 Test Environment  
- **Test Vehicles:** CarMaker models with Digital Key support (e.g., CarMaker A Series, B Series, etc.).  
- **Test Devices:** iPhones (iOS 16+), Android devices with CCC Digital Key 3.0 support.  
- **Connectivity Protocols:** NFC, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Ultra-Wideband (UWB).  

## 2. Test Objectives  
- Validate compliance with **CCC Digital Key standards**.  
- Ensure secure **key provisioning, authentication, and revocation**.  
- Verify seamless **interoperability** between CarMaker vehicles and different smartphones.  
- Identify and resolve any performance bottlenecks.  

## 3. Test Strategy  
### 3.1 Testing Types  

| Test Type                | Description |
|--------------------------|------------|
| **Unit Testing**         | Testing individual components (e.g., key provisioning, storage). |
| **Integration Testing**  | Ensuring digital key components work together (app, vehicle, cloud). |
| **System Testing**       | Verifying the complete **end-to-end** workflow. |
| **Interoperability Testing** | Ensuring cross-platform compatibility with multiple devices. |
| **Security Testing**     | Evaluating encryption, authentication, and resistance to cyber threats. |
| **Performance Testing**  | Measuring response time and power consumption. |

## 4. Test Cases  
### 4.1 Functional Testing  

| Test ID  | Test Case | Expected Result |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **FT-001** | Create a digital key from the CarMaker app | Key is successfully created |
| **FT-002** | Store key in Apple Wallet / Google Wallet | Key appears in Wallet |
| **FT-003** | Lock/unlock vehicle using NFC | Car locks/unlocks |
| **FT-004** | Start the car using the digital key | Engine starts |
| **FT-005** | Share digital key with another user | Key is shared successfully |
| **FT-006** | Revoke a shared key | Key access is removed |

### 4.2 Security Testing  

| Test ID  | Test Case | Expected Result |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **ST-001** | Attempt unauthorized key access | Access denied |
| **ST-002** | MITM attack on key transfer | Data remains encrypted |
| **ST-003** | Test BLE/UWB encryption | Communication is secure |

### 4.3 Interoperability Testing  

| Test ID  | Test Case | Expected Result |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **IT-001** | Use the digital key on different smartphones | Key works across devices |
| **IT-002** | Test with different CarMaker models | Key works on supported models |

### 4.4 Performance Testing  

| Test ID  | Test Case | Expected Result |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **PT-001** | Measure key provisioning time | Less than 5 seconds |
| **PT-002** | Measure unlock latency | Less than 1 second |
| **PT-003** | Measure power consumption | Minimal battery drain |

## 5. Test Execution Plan
